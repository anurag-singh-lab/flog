<p><strong>What is<i> </i>term Insurance?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term insurance provides financial protection to your family against a fixed premium paidfor a specified term. It is a pure risk cover form of life insurance. Pure risk cover implies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the insurance company doesn’t have to splurge out the sum assured if the insured </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">survives the policy term. Because you let go maturity benefits, term insurance policies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">usually demand less premium than other forms of insurance. And once the premium </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">amount is set, it remains the same. This also makes it an effective hedge against rising  Inflation. </span></p>
<p><strong>What   is   joint   term   insurance?<i> </i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint term insurance is a type of term insurance policy that covers two people but pays out once. The payout can be made upon the death of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first partner (first-to-die life insurance) – the payout is made to the surviving partner allowing the surviving partner to maintain his/ her lifestyle, or </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">both the partners (second-to-die life insurance) –  the payout benefit goes  to the couple’s beneficiaries who can be the couple's children, relatives or anyone else. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This joint term insurance can prove to be a great estate planning instrument. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The sum assured may be received as -</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular payments for a fixed term, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lump-sum payment, ending the policy there, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a combination of lump-sum and regular payments </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the above, why should couples choose joint term insurance over two separate term plans? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)</span><strong>Affordability</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term insurance is generally more economical than other forms of insurance. Joint term </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance can prove to be even more affordable. With separate covers, insurance comp-anies face a likely pay out of say INR 50,00,000 as against a joint term insurance where the pay- out will be half of INR 50,00,000. Hence, the coverage under joint term insurance is less expensive vis-à-vis 2 separate insurance covers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)</span><strong>Tax savings (that too twice)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 80C and 80D of the Income-Tax Act (the Act), 1961 allow premium paid to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deducted from total income thereby bringing down your taxable income and taxes thereon. It is worth keeping in mind that only the partner who actually pays the premium will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be allowed a deduction under these sections. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payout received upon the death of the insured is exempt under section 10(10D) of the Act, i.e., the payout is not even considered as income in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)</span><strong>Minimal hassle</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">-  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that a single policy can be managed more easily than two separate policies. There is less paperwork involved, any one of the partners can pay the premium on behalf of the two of them, and both partners can access the policy account </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and keep a track of it jointly/severally. Isn’t it great for planning your finances as a team?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4)</span><strong>Great for young couples</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death is inevitable. But young people have age by their side. The odds of them passing away during the insurance term are stacked against them.Which is why buying two insu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rance policies, when they can buy just one but enjoy the benefits of two, makes little </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sense. Young couples can pay less premium for a large sum assured in case of a joint </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">term insurance policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5)</span><strong>Riders</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rider is an insurance policy provision that adds benefits to or amends the terms of a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basic insurance policy to provide additional coverage. In other words, riders help create </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customised insurance policies. Joint term insurance plans are available with riders which help couples to tweak their policies to suit their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6)</span><strong>Estate planning</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second-to-die life insurance can help in the estate planning needs of couples.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7)</span><strong>Standard of living</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By receiving the pay-out upon the death of a partner, first-to-death policies can help the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surviving partner maintain his/ her lifestyle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The likelihood of the couple not remaining a couple anymore is perhaps the biggest reason why a couple should not opt for a joint term insurance. The other reason being the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">beneficiary will receive only one payout benefit (but you also paid less premium for that, remember?).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now go and check your insurance needs and plan your finances accordingly. </span></p>
