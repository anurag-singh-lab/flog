<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…my heart never beats as fast as it does when I see a ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced by 50%’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sign.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s Rebecca Bloomwood for you from the 2009 movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confessions of a Shopaholic’</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you who don’t know, she suffered from Compulsive Buying Disorder (it’s a real thing, people are writing thesis on it!). Mannequins lured her into buying stuff she didn’t need, eventually, leading her into a debt trap. But because it’s a movie, Rebecca’s prince charming comes to her rescue and the movie ends on a happy note.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-life as we know is far from movies. Your prince/ princess charming can’t necessarily help you out (that is if you have one) and impulsive buying can have serious consequences. So, let’s learn how to be our own heroes-</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 30-day rule – The shoes in front of you are irresistible. Or so you think. Wait for 30 days. If after those 30 days, you still want to buy them, go ahead. Else, you sure have forgotten about them.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a budget. Make a list. Going shopping without planning is like shooting in the dark, with the arrow pointed towards your own self.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you come back, make a list again, to see where you exceeded and where you could have saved. Were you tricked into buying something? What were you thinking when you bought that? Write it all down. This makes your resolve stronger when you go shopping the next time.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do away with shopping apps and credit card information on your phone. You didn’t earn money in a click. You don’t want to burn it in a click.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be a hoarder. Don’t forget the environmental cost of anything that you buy. Whenever you buy something new, first recycle/ upcycle something from the old. Thinking of getting a new phone cover or even a new phone, first spiff up what you already own. You don’t want to get rid of your old things, don’t buy new things. Simple. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have your partner by your side, so that one can always hold the other accountable. Well, Fibbl can help you here. They give you a detailed check on your and your partner’s spending habits.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember what Emma Watson once said, “…you have a family to feed, not a community to impress”. You should own things and not the other way round. It’s not a very smart thing to buy things with the sole objective of showing off to the world.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are fighting against marketers using every psychological trick in the book to tempt you into buying their products/ services. When in the salon, you are made to feel like your hair needs immediate attention before you go bald. Almost everything that you buy online is soon getting out of stock or is on sale (to create a sense of urgency so you buy those ASAP). Everybody is trying to sell you something. Do yourself a favor. Save yourself from buyer’s remorse.</span></p>

            <![CDATA[
                <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/6/Neobank.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/6/responsive/Neobank-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/6/responsive/Neobank-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/6/responsive/Neobank-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/6/responsive/Neobank-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/6/responsive/Neobank-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/6/responsive/Neobank-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1640" height="924"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in an age and time, where we turn to digital solutions for practically everything from education and shopping to entertainment and food delivery. A little lethargic to join the digital bandwagon is the banking sector. It’s mired by ridiculously slow net-banking services, apps that do not function, and an overall experience that leaves its customers dissatisfied. This is all set to change. Neobanks are rapidly taking over in a bid to provide customers with a seamless, frictionless, digital banking experience.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are Neobanks?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are virtual banks, meaning, they do not have a physical presence. They use new-age technologies to provide financial services that are quicker, hassle-free, and more efficient. Neobanks offer solutions that conventional banks have so far failed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In India, neobanks and conventional banks are not mutually exclusive from each other. To explain this, let me first take you through the types of neobanks out there-</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks that don’t have a banking license themselves and hence, partner up with a licensed bank to function. These can be simply understood as FinTech firms providing auxiliary financial/banking-related services and not banking (taking deposits and giving away loans) services per se.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks that obtain banking licenses themselves to operate independently. These neobanks stand in direct competition with the age-old legacy banks and hence, often called ‘challenger banks’</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In India, neobanks are not allowed to hold banking licenses yet. While licensed banks hold deposits and give away loans, neobanks control customers’ front-end digital banking user interface and use apps to connect them to those licensed banks. All in all, neobanks and legacy banks work in tandem and support each other’s work.</span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Neobanks in numbers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kakao and Toss (K-banks) already serve up to 1/4th of the entire South Korean population. These were valued at $9.9 billion and $7.4 billion respectively in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, traditional banks are on a steady decline. Its Revolut is valued at around $33 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">America’s Chime is estimated to be worth $40 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank of Brazil, a country particularly riddled with bad banking infrastructure, was valued at $52 billion at the time of its IPO last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABI Research</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicts that the top 57 neobanks worldwide will cater to approx. 591 million users worldwide by 2026. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zion Market Research</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a market research firm based out of New York, the global neo banking industry is expected to generate earnings of around USD 394,648 million by 2026, at a CAGR of around 46.5%.</span></p>
<p><strong>The problems that neobanks solve-</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not for no reason that neobanks boast of such staggering valuations. Charged with technology, the possibility of them helping people and businesses is endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>B2B Neobanks</strong>- </span>Neobanks have proved to be especially useful for freelancers and medium and small enterprises which have hitherto been neglected by both the banking and IT sectors. Listed below are a few services which they provide and are gaining traction –</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expense management – At present employees first make expenses out of their own pockets and later get reimbursed. Neobanks issue prepaid debit cards using which employees make payments straight out of the company’s resources. Businesses can add or cancel cards anytime, assign multiple cards to their employees, set limits, and track expenses in real-time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working capital credit lines – It is extremely difficult for businesses, especially SMEs, to get loans sanctioned for their working capital needs. Basis the cash flows generated by SMEs, neobanks can offer to provide better and faster working capital loans without placing assets on collateral. They also provide much-needed flexibility in payment terms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payroll management – Neobanks leverage technology to provide smooth, and fully automated payroll disbursement and compliance services. From onboarding to full and final settlement, and everything in between -taxes, accounting, PF- neobanks can handle everything.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash management - Neobanks help businesses keep a track of their finances in real-time with a finance dashboard, manage their current accounts, and automate payables and receivables management, generate cash flow statements and P/L accounts.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>B2C Neobanks</strong>- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks are especially suited to the young, tech-savvy population which is increasingly getting used to getting work done in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">click.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the B2C space, neobanks work in super niche domains-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobank for couples, allowing them to collaborate on shared spending. Couples get a digital joint account with 2 debit cards, 2 UPIs, and individual app access. Fibbl is one such neobank.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teen Banks – While in traditional banks, juveniles cannot open an account independently, neobanks do not come with such restrictions. In exchange for opening a fully digital wallet, neobanks give your teens a debit card, at the same time allowing their guardians to keep a watch on their spending. Keeping kids in mind, teen banks usually come with a gamified interface and an excellent reward system in place.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pride Bank of Brazil, Daylight of the US are neobanks that serve exclusively to the LGBTQ+ community, Purple based out of the US caters just to the specially-abled people, Nerve is the world’s first neobank that understands the financial needs of professional musicians.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks provide hyper-personalized money management tools, making people track and analyze their finances like never before.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What drives the growth?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet penetration, an ever-increasing demand for smartphones, a huge underbanked and underserved population, needless to mention the advent of leading-age technologies like IoT, AI, cloud computing, Big Data, have all combined to make neo banking a rising industry. If classrooms and business meetings can be held online, what’s taking banking so long?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping up with the times, regulators worldwide, are coming up with newer regulations to support this new breed of banks. NITI Aayog is awarding neobanks with a restricted Digital Business Bank license which can gradually be converted to a Full Stack Digital Banking license. These will be monitored on matrices such as volume of credit disbursed to MSMEs, level of compliance, and customer acquisition cost (CAC).</span></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion- </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional Banking is getting digitized. But it is too little, too late. Neobanks are giving the new-age people what they already have elsewhere - superly customized, completely digital, cost-effective, tech-centered, app-based solutions. Banking is at the cusp of change and neobanks are leading that change from the front.</span></p>

                <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/5/metaverse-3.jpeg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/5/responsive/metaverse-3-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/5/responsive/metaverse-3-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/5/responsive/metaverse-3-md.jpeg 768w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/5/responsive/metaverse-3-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/5/responsive/metaverse-3-xl.jpeg 1360w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/5/responsive/metaverse-3-2xl.jpeg 1600w"  alt="" width="1828" height="1248"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A world so advanced in technology demands a universe of reality in itself. In layman’s language, a metaverse is a virtual platform where people can engage in real-world experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can have your own avatar, designed in the manner you prefer, play games and interact with people on a metaverse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply, it’s like real life playing out in a virtual world. The term might be new to you but it has been coined, described and explored in fiction and in practice about thirty years ago. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>After Facebook announced its rebrand to Meta in October 2021, the term spiked 25x in popularity.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Metaverse?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The metaverse is formed by combining the words meta, which means beyond, and verse, which means universe. It's a virtual world where people can interact with each other as avatars. Because it is more of a technological concept than a product, it is device-independent and not held by a single vendor. Consider it a more advanced version of the Internet, where instead of merely looking at it, people live in it, but not literally. Lands, buildings, avatars, and other tangible entities can be bought and sold in the metaverse, which is a shared virtual world where cryptocurrency is frequently used.</span></p>
<p><strong>Gartner</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expects that by 2026, 25% of people will spend at least one hour a day in the metaverse for work, shopping, education, social media and/or entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two important aspects of Metaverse are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Virtual Economy: An economy which exists in a virtual world where users can create, buy or sell virtual goods using cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) NFT: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are exclusive blockchain-based digital assets like digital art or music and often consist of tokenized physical assets like houses or cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guess what? </span><strong>People are also tying the knot in this virtual utopia. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, In India a couple from Tamil Nadu held their wedding reception in a metaverse designed by the groom, Dinesh Sivakumar Padmavathi. Covid restrictions on weddings led Dinesh, a tech-savvy and a lover of blockchain, to come up with this new idea of a wedding ceremony, inviting one and many to their new and grand celebration. The couple, big Potterheads, themed their metaverse wedding as Hogwarts. They are not just the first couple in India but also in Asia to tread into the territory of celebrating a marriage in virtual reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Abhijeet and Sansratii, a couple from Bhopal got married on a metaverse, with a beachside as their venue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-covid era is not just about one’s dependence on technology and the internet but also reaping the benefits of the same. A metaverse wedding has recently gained popularity because of restrictions in public places. People from anywhere on earth can be a part of this metaverse alongside others. Thus, this virtual wedding can be seen as a celebratory replacement for the actual ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can reach out and contact companies that are venturing into the idea of building a metaverse and get your own virtual platform designed according to your likes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a quick look at the advantages of a metaverse wedding!</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A metaverse is a dream you always wished for. You can create, customize and personalize your own metaverse.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ample space! You don’t have to worry about the accommodation of all your guests.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can present, share and chat and involve people digitally. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can give and receive NFTs on this platform. This holds real world value.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A metaverse cannot compensate for a real-life experience but can surely be seen as a cost-effective alternative. Also, the fun and the celebration is all real but the marriage cannot be legalized on a metaverse platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, you and your partner will have to sign official documents for the marriage to be legal.</span></p>

                <figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/4/Emergency.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Emergency-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Emergency-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Emergency-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Emergency-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Emergency-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fibbl.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Emergency-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1640" height="924"></figure>
<p class="p3">How often has life caught us off-guard? Remember all the times when life threw real sour lemons at us and we were unable to lemonade them? It doesn’t take a genius to guess that the only certainty in life lies in its uncertainty. And while so many things that happen to us are beyond our control there is one thing that is totally in our hands. Facing every contingency that life has in store for us with an Emergency Fund!</p>
<p><strong>Why an Emergency Fund you ask? </strong></p>
<p>This fund is second in line to protect you against financial uncertainties. The first is your life/ health insurance. But not everything can be insured. For instance, your monthly rent payment. And you do not want to ask friends and family for a pecuniary favour or break your long-term investments for that matter.</p>
<p class="p5"><strong>Where to keep Emergency Fund?</strong></p>
<p>Experts suggest that you should maintain an Emergency Fund that covers at least 6-months of your basic expenses. This fund should be highly liquid with no risks attached. Hence, your options here include keeping the funds in cash, savings account, fixed deposit (FD), and liquid mutual funds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cash</strong> – Cash is well, cash. Yes, that cash in your wallet is your Emergency Fund. The catch here is you are not supposed to burn this cash. You need to keep it safe and use it only in an emergency. So set aside some amount of cash from your wallet to some other wallet that is out of your daily reach.</li>
<li><strong>Savings account</strong> – Here again, create a separate savings account or earmark some amount in your regular savings account or create a recurring deposit (RD), and DO NOT use it until you are in a fix.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Deposit–</strong> This is your deposit with a bank against which you get a fixed interest. The FD rates are higher than savings account interest rates. Long-term FDs (5 years or more) provide higher interest. Do note that premature withdrawal of money from FD attracts a penalty.Different banks provide different interest rates. Please check with your banker the interest rate that your bank provides. Also, it makes little sense to keep hopping from one bank to the other to simply earn 1-2% extra interest income.</li>
<li><strong>Liquid mutual funds</strong> – Allow me to break to you another certainty - your hard-earned money will die a slow (or not so-slow?) death. We often call it inflation. It is here that liquid mutual funds prove to be the most beneficial. They may or may not be able to beat inflation, but they will in all likelihood give you a return at par with inflation. These may, however, take up to 1-2 working days to be liquidated. </li>
</ul>
<p class="p5">You may also want to keep your tax expense in mind. The tax laws of our country change every year. As of now, redemption of debt mutual funds after 3 years (long-term capital gain) attracts a 20% tax rate with indexation benefit. Interest from savings account is not taxed up to INR 10,000, post which it is taxed at slab rates Interest from FD is taxed at slab rates. Cash, of course, is not taxed at all.</p>
<p class="p5">One can choose from any of the options listed above to maintain an Emergency Fund. You may choose to deposit some funds in all of these in varying proportions. Do remember, the idea here is not to make/ grow money, but to have some money handy should we need it one day. </p>
<p class="p5">Should couples decide to go for a joint Emergency Fund? If you guys get along well, you may want to sync your financial life as well. You may decide to have two separate Emergency Funds but make sure you discuss your household expenses and have regular money conversations with each other.</p>
<p>So, make a budget, keep a check on your and your partner’s unnecessary expenses (make sure you don’t become too nosy) and gradually make an Emergency Fund your future self will thank you for. Although we seriously hope that you never find yourself in a situation like that.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance can be tricky to understand. But that can’t be an excuse to ignore it, for insurance can be a life saviour – not your life, your loved ones’ lives! In this blog post, we decode a relatively new concept of </span><strong>joint term insurance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and help you better understand the nitty-gritties of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s clear the basics first.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is term insurance?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term insurance provides financial protection to your family against a fixed premium paid for a specified term. It is a pure risk cover form of life insurance. Pure risk cover implies that the insurance company doesn’t have to splurge out the sum assured if the insured survives the policy term. Because you let go maturity benefits, term insurance policies usually demand less premium than other forms of insurance. And once the premium amount is set, it remains the same. This also makes it an effective hedge against rising inflation.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is joint term insurance?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint term insurance is a type of term insurance policy that covers </span><strong>two people</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but pays out once. The pay-out can be made upon the death of -</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first partner (first-to-die life insurance) – the pay-out is made to the surviving partner, allowing the surviving partner to maintain his/ her lifestyle, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">both the partners (second-to-die life insurance) – the pay-out benefit goes to the couple’s beneficiaries who can be the couple’s children, relatives or anyone else. This joint term insurance can prove to be a great estate planning instrument.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sum assured may be received as -</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regular payments for a fixed term, or-</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lump-sum payment, ending the policy there, or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a combination of lump-sum and regular payments</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the above, <strong>why should couples choose joint term insurance over two separate term plans?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">1. Economically viable:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Term insurance is generally more economical than other forms of insurance. Joint term insurance can prove to be even more affordable. With separate covers, insurance companies face a likely pay-out of say INR 50,00,000 as against a joint term insurance where the pay-out will be half of INR 50,00,000. Hence, the coverage offered under joint term insurance is less expensive vis-à-vis 2 separate insurance covers.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">2. Tax savings (that too twice)-</span></strong></div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 80C of the Income-Tax Act (the Act), 1961 allow premium paid to be deducted from total income thereby bringing down your taxable income and taxes thereon. It is worth keeping in mind that only the partner who actually pays the premium will be allowed a deduction under these sections.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pay-out received upon the death of the insured is exempt under section 10(10D) of the Act, i.e., the pay-out is not even considered as income in the first place.</span></div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;"><br></span></strong><strong>3. Minimal hassle- </strong></div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">It goes without saying that a single policy can be managed more easily than two separate policies. There is less paperwork involved, any one of the partners can pay the premium on behalf of the two of them, and both partners can access the policy account and keep a track of it jointly/ severally. Isn’t it great for planning your finances as a team?</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">4. Great for young couples-</span></strong></div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Death is inevitable. But young people have age by their side. The odds of them passing away during the insurance term are stacked against them. Which is why buying two insurance policies, when they can buy just one but enjoy the benefits of two, makes little sense. Young couples can pay less premium for a large sum assured in case of a joint term insurance policy.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><strong>5. Riders-</strong></div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">A rider is an insurance policy provision that amends the terms of a basic insurance policy to provide additional coverage. In other words, riders help create customised insurance policies. Joint term insurance plans are available with riders which help couples to tweak their policies to suit their needs.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong>6. Estate planning</strong>-</span></div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Second-to-die life insurance can help in the estate planning needs of couples. However, this arrangement is best suited with a whole life insurance policy. This is because if the insurance term ends before the passing away of the second holder, the policy lapses and the beneficiaries receive nothing.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><strong><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">7. Standard of living-</span></strong></div>
<div class="zw-line-div"><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">By receiving the pay-out upon the death of a partner, joint term policies can help the surviving partner maintain his/ her lifestyle.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance policies go a long way in keeping you and family financially secure. It is the first and strongest shield against any uncertainty that life throws at you. Understand your money needs, check with your agent and take the right step towards your and your family’s well-being.</span></p>
